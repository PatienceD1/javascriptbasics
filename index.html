    <h1>Hello World! This is the JavaScript Basics HTML page</h1>
    <p>I'm creating this page because on Decemeber 22nd, at 11am I have a technical interview with the Oracle OCI team
        for a UI Engineer position. I want to use this page to brush up on my JavaScript skills when it comes to
        functions, API calls, DOM manipulation, and so much more.</p>


    <script>
        //Calling an outer variable
        let nub = "Anubis";

        function anubis() {
            let message = "Hello! My name is " + nub;
            console.log(message);
        }
        anubis();

        //Arrays
        let fruits = ["apple", { name: 'Bill' }, "orange", "strawberries"];
        console.log(fruits[0]); //apple
        console.log(fruits[1].name); //Bill
        console.log(fruits.length); //3
        console.log(fruits);

        //Stack (add and take from the end of an array)
        let dogs = ["Anubis", "Osiris", "Duke"];
        console.log(dogs.pop()); //removes Duke from array and console log it
        dogs.push("Kira"); //add Kira to the end of the array
        //console.log(dogs.push("Kira")); is the same as finding the length of the array
        console.log(dogs);

        //Queue (add and take from the beginning of an array)
        let fastfood = ["Burger King", "Mc Donalds", "Wendy's"];
        console.log(fastfood.shift()); //takes first item and logs it
        fastfood.unshift("Arby's"); //adds item to the beginning of the array
        //console.log(fastfood.push("Arbys")); is the same as finding the length of the array
        console.log(fastfood);

        //Reverse a linked list (iterative)
        const reverselist = head => {
            let prev = null;
            let next = null;
            let current = head;
            while (current !== null) {
                next = current.next //we need to store the next node of current before changing
                current.next = prev //we can now change next of current by reversing the link
                prev = current //this step moves the previous node forward
                current = next //this step moves the current node forward
            }
            return prev //new head of the list
        };

        //prev: This pointer will track the node previous to the current node and we will set it to null because a singly link list node does not have a reference to its previous node.
        //current: This one will start at the head of the list and keep track of the node we are currently on.
        //next: This pointer will store the next node before its reference is changed and it is initially set to null.

        //The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because our approach is reversing the list in place and not using any additional space.
